To complie :

0.  You need lame(mp3 encoder) at first. You can download source code 
    from the website below, and build "libmp3lame.a" on your platform.

    http://lame.sourceforge.net/

1.  'cd' to the project directory which fits your environment, such as 
    ./proj/osx or ./proj/linux. Make a directory "lib", copy the 
    "libmp3lame.a" to the "lib" directory.

2.  make         

That's it!
